A 3D physics-based sticky note simulator built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and React Three Cannon.

## Features

- Interactive 3D sticky notes with realistic physics
- Drag and drop functionality
- Collision detection
- Realistic physics simulation
- Beautiful material effects

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 14
- React Three Fiber
- React Three Cannon
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/niravbeni/stickynote-sim.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd stickynote-sim
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage
